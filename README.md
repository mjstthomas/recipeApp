Quick Chef

https://mjstthomas.github.io/recipeApp/

Summary

When you have food in the fridge but don't know what to make, Quick Chef will randomly render a recipe that includes those ingredients for you.  It takes the guess work out of dinner.  It even allows you to choose cuisine type or a diet that you are following.  To supplement the diet minded, there is a seperate call that adds a nutritional information widget to a second screen that can be opened with the tap of the nutrition icon.
